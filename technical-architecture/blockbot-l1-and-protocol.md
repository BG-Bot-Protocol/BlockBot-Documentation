# BlockBot L1 and Protocol

## Introduction

The purpose of the **BlockBot L1** and **the protocol** is to enable users and developers to:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Create account-abstracted smart wallets

These wallets could support gasless transactions and social login and passkey authentication, removing the need for private key management.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Integrate APIs that support sending **crypto**&#x20;

This technology could allow sending **crypto on chat platforms as easily as sending a WhatsApp message**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Play and Earn

Users could earn yields via staking or by playing games and completing tasks.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Protocol participants

### The BlockBot L1 and protocol

The BlockBot L1 and protocol are built using [the Avalanche L1 technology stack](https://build.avax.network/docs/quick-start/avalanche-l1s). The architecture consists of:

1. **The L1 blockchain** serves as the support infrastructure for onchain transaction execution.
2. **The off-chain software component** (currently, [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) business api integration) used to deliver service to web2 native users.

### Developers

**Developers** also participate in the protocol by:

* integrating our in-house built api ([widget SDK](../for-developers/integrating-blockbot-widget-or-overview.md)) into other chat and web-based platforms,
* building other essential applications/tooling or integrations on the BlockBot L1, such as DEX aggregators, games, and the likes.

This would be made possible as we intend to make BlockBot L1 **permissionless** to allow contributions from external developers.

### Users

Users participate in the protocol by:

* **Testing** the BlockBot L1 chain that is currently live on testnet ([click here to see a guide on getting started with the testnet](../for-users/testnet-guide.md)).
* **Sending** crypto to friends, family, or merchants via the BlockBot L1 chain
* **Earning** rewards for staking, playing games, and completing tasks.

### Merchants

Merchants can participate in the protocol by:

* **Receiving** payments (blockchain settled payments) from their customers just by inputting their business name/tag (similar to an _.ens domain_ name)
* **Sending** payments (blockchain-settled payments) to their customers or suppliers
* **Rewarding** NFTs or digital badges to their loyal customers for their patronage.
